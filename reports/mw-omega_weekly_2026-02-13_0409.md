# MW-Ω WEEKLY BRIEFING
**Date**: Monday, Week of [Current]
**Energy Budget**: 20 hours
**System Status**: CRITICAL — Multiple stop rule violations active

---

## 1. STOP RULE CHECK

### 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (Worsening)
**Liquidity Floor Breach**: 
- Target: $50K minimum | Current: ~$0K operating cash
- **Status**: SEVERE — 100% below floor
- **Trend**: Deteriorating (no income diversification executed)
- **Consequence**: Zero operational runway, total dependency on single revenue stream

**Revenue Concentration**: 
- Target: <25% single source | Current: 79.3% (single contract)
- **Status**: EXTREME risk exposure
- **Trend**: Static (no consulting pipeline built)
- **Consequence**: One client loss = full system collapse

### 🟡 STRUCTURAL VIOLATIONS (Stable but unresolved)
**Founder Irrelevance Score**: 12.4/100 (target: 60+)
- System requires Abraham's direct involvement for all decisions
- No documented processes for routine operations
- **Trend**: No improvement actions taken

**Cash Reserves SPOF**: 25% centrality (target: <15%)
- Financial operations have no backup/automation
- **Trend**: Unchanged

## 2. QUEUE STATUS

| # | Item | Status | Blocker/Action |
|---|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Fill Financial Tracker | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Requires 2hr focus block + bank data access |
| 2 | Founder absence test (Mar 14) | 🟡 **PLANNED** | 17 days out — needs pre-work this week |
| 3 | Quarterly scan (Mar 1) | 🟡 **DUE** | 4 days — needs 3hr block |
| 4 | First consulting outreach | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | No offer/positioning doc exists |
| 5 | Asset registry update | 🟢 **ACTIVE** | Can execute in 30min |

### RECOMMENDED REORDER:
1. **Quarterly scan** (due imminently)
2. **Financial Tracker** (unlocks liquidity visibility)
3. **Consulting offer doc** (unlocks Item 4)
4. **Asset registry update** (quick win)
5. **Founder absence test** (sufficient lead time)

---

## 3. ENERGY AUDIT (20hr allocation)

### RECOMMENDED DISTRIBUTION:

**HIGH PRIORITY (14 hours)**
- **Revenue Operations** (6hr): Build consulting offer + first 3 outreach targets
- **System Building** (5hr): Quarterly scan + Financial Tracker completion
- **Administrative** (3hr): Legal entity check + tax prep review (Q1 approaching)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (4 hours)**
- **Content Shipping** (4hr): One essay OR music session (not both)

**RESERVE (2 hours)**
- **Unstructured buffer** for emergencies/discovery

### RATIONALE:
Current stop rule violations require **survival-mode allocation**. Content is sacred but won't resolve cash crisis. Shift to 70% operations until liquidity floor restored.

---

## 4. SHIPMENT FORECAST

### CAN SHIP THIS WEEK:
✅ **Quarterly Scan Report** (target: Thu)
✅ **Financial Tracker v1** (real data loaded, target: Wed)
✅ **Consulting Offer Document** (1-pager, target: Fri)
✅ **Asset Registry Update** (target: Tue)

### CANNOT SHIP (insufficient energy):

❌ Framework documentation
❌ Founder absence test (wrong timeline)

### STRETCH GOAL:
⚡ **First consulting outreach sent** (if offer doc completes early)

---

## 5. RISK FLAGS

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED:

**Tax Deadline Approaching** (Apr 15, ~6 weeks)
- No Q4 2024 bookkeeping reconciliation visible
- LLC tax treatment confirmation needed
- **Action**: Schedule 1hr with accountant THIS WEEK

**Contract Renewal Visibility**
- 79.3% revenue from single source — when does it renew?
- **Action**: Confirm contract end date + renewal terms (15min)

**Health Insurance Gap Risk**
- Self-employed status — coverage confirmed for 2025?
- **Action**: Verify active policy (10min check)

### 🟡 MONITORING (not urgent this week):
- Founder absence test logistics (plan by Mar 7)
- Q1 2025 revenue target definition (plan by Mar 15)

---

## DECISION: WEEK EXECUTION LOCK

**APPROVED FOCUS**:
1. Complete Quarterly Scan (Thu)
2. Load Financial Tracker (Wed)
3. Ship Consulting Offer (Fri)
4. Update Asset Registry (Tue)
5. Tax/legal admin check (1hr, any day)

**DEFERRED**:
- All content creation beyond one 2-4hr session
- Framework documentation
- New system exploration

**STOP RULE IMPACT**:
- Financial Tracker → reduces Cash_Reserves SPOF centrality
- Consulting Offer → begins reducing Revenue Concentration
- Quarterly Scan → provides Founder Irrelevance baseline data

**Next briefing**: Monday, 7 days from now
