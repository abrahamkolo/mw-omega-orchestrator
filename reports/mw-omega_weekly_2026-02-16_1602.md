# MW-Ω WEEKLY BRIEFING
**Date:** Week of [Current Date]
**Status:** CRITICAL — Multiple stop rule violations active

---

## 1. STOP RULE CHECK

### 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (Worsening trajectory)
- **Liquidity Floor Breach**: $50K vs $192K minimum (74% shortfall)
  - **Direction**: Likely worsening (no revenue diversification active)
  - **Consequence**: Zero margin for error, any surprise expense = systemic failure

- **Revenue Concentration**: 79.3% single-stream dependency
  - **Direction**: Static (no consulting pipeline active yet)
  - **Consequence**: One client decision controls survival

### 🟡 CHRONIC VIOLATIONS (Stable but unacceptable)
- **Founder Irrelevance**: 12.4/100 (target: 60+)
  - **Direction**: Static
  - **Gap to target**: 385% improvement needed
  
- **Cash_Reserves SPOF**: 25% centrality
  - **Direction**: Static
  - **Gap to target**: 67% reduction needed

### ⚠️ ASSESSMENT
System is in **survival mode**, not build mode. Every decision must reduce dependency or add liquidity buffer.

## 2. QUEUE STATUS

| # | Item | Status | Blocker/Next Action |
|---|------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Fill Financial Tracker | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Missing real account data. Needs 2hr session with bank statements. |
| 2 | Founder absence test (Mar 14) | 🟡 **ACTIVE** | 3 weeks out. Requires documented delegation protocol first. |
| 3 | Quarterly scan (Mar 1) | 🟢 **ON TRACK** | 10 days out. Template exists, needs 3hr execution block. |
| 4 | First consulting outreach | 🔴 **NOT STARTED** | No positioning document, no target list, no outreach copy. |
| 5 | Asset registry update | 🟡 **PARTIAL** | Shipped counts unknown. Needs inventory reconciliation. |

### RECOMMENDED REORDER
**Current order prioritizes visibility over survival.** Suggest:

1. **First consulting outreach** (revenue diversification — addresses 2 stop rules)
2. **Fill Financial Tracker** (enables intelligent decision-making)
3. **Quarterly scan** (scheduled, lower urgency)
4. **Founder absence test** (systemization, but not immediate survival need)
5. **Asset registry update** (operational hygiene, not critical path)

---

## 3. ENERGY AUDIT (20hr week)

### RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION

**Revenue Operations: 10 hours** (50%)
- Consulting positioning document (3hr)
- Target client research + outreach list (2hr)
- First 10 outreach messages (2hr)
- Financial tracker completion (2hr)
- Revenue forecast model (1hr)

**System Building: 5 hours** (25%)
- Delegation protocol for Mar 14 test (3hr)
- Quarterly scan execution (2hr)

**Content Shipping: 3 hours** (15%)
- One essay/reflection (protects brand visibility during pivot)

**Administrative: 2 hours** (10%)
- Asset inventory reconciliation (1hr)
- Legal/financial inbox zero (1hr)

### RATIONALE
- **50% revenue ops**: Stop rules demand immediate cash diversification
- **Zero music/book time**: Survival trumps legacy-building this week
- **Minimal content**: Maintain presence without draining survival capacity

---

## 4. SHIPMENT FORECAST

### CAN SHIP THIS WEEK
✅ Consulting positioning document (MVP v1)  
✅ First 10 consulting outreach messages sent  
✅ Financial tracker with real data  
✅ Quarterly scan report  
✅ One public essay/update  

### CANNOT SHIP (insufficient energy/dependencies)
❌ Consulting revenue (outreach → conversation → close takes 2-6 weeks)  
❌ Complete founder absence protocol (Mar 14 is execution, not completion)  
❌ Asset registry full reconciliation (requires external coordination)  

### STRETCH GOAL
- If consulting outreach generates immediate conversation, compress essay time to prep discovery calls

---

## 5. RISK FLAGS

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

**Risk A: Financial Tracker Blind Spot**
- **Issue**: Operating without real-time financial visibility
- **Impact**: Cannot make informed decisions on spend, runway, or pricing
- **Action**: 2-hour session THIS WEEK to populate tracker with actual data
- **Deadline**: Wednesday EOD

**Risk B: Consulting Cold Start**
- **Issue**: Zero active consulting pipeline with 79% revenue concentration
- **Impact**: No diversification safety net if primary revenue shifts
- **Action**: Ship positioning doc + first outreach by Friday
- **Deadline**: Friday EOD

**Risk C: March 14 Founder Test Unprepped**
- **Issue**: 21 days to absence test, no delegation playbook exists
- **Impact**: Test will fail, revealing nothing actionable
- **Action**: Document 5 critical workflows + assign deputies this week
- **Deadline**: Friday EOD (allows 2 weeks for deputy onboarding)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**System State**: Critical but stable. No immediate collapse risk, but zero resilience.

**This Week's Mission**: Build the first layer of redundancy (financial visibility + revenue diversification start + delegation foundation).

**Success Criteria**: 
- Tracker shows real numbers
- 10 consulting prospects contacted
- 5 workflows documented for Mar 14 test

**Failure Mode**: Treating this as "another week" instead of a survival sprint.

**Recommendation**: Execute the reordered queue. Defer all non-survival work. Ship ugly v1s. Perfect is the enemy of solvent.

---

**Next briefing**: Monday, [+7 days]  
**MW-Ω standing by for execution decisions.**
